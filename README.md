# ChatGPT Feature Proposal: Split View (Main Thread + Side Thread for Doubts)

**Author:** Animesh Mishra  
**Date:** 2026-01-21  
**Status:** Feature Proposal / Feedback

---

## Summary
When users interact with ChatGPT for learning, planning, or problem-solving, they often ask follow-up questions or explore side topics. Over time, the conversation becomes cluttered, making it difficult to revisit the original explanation or workflow.

This proposal suggests a **Split View / Split Chat** feature that allows users to keep:
1. **Main Thread** (core discussion / original goal)
2. **Side Thread (Doubts / Clarifications / Tangents)**

This improves clarity, revision, and usability for both students and regular users.

---

## Problem
ChatGPT conversations frequently branch into doubts, clarifications, and tangents. This creates issues such as:
- the main discussion becomes hard to follow
- important explanations get buried
- users lose track of the original goal
- revisiting the conversation later becomes inefficient

---

## Proposed Solution
Introduce a **Split View / Dual-Thread Mode**:

### Main Panel: "Main Thread"
- primary explanation / plan / task flow
- structured output (steps, notes, summaries)

### Side Panel: "Side Thread" (Doubts / Clarifications)
- follow-up questions
- quick clarifications
- related tangents that shouldn’t clutter the main thread

Users can open/close this panel anytime and switch between threads smoothly.

---

## Example Use Cases

### 1) Learning
- Main Thread: "Explain Deadlocks"
- Side Thread: "What is Banker’s Algorithm?"

### 2) Coding / Debugging
- Main Thread: "Build a MERN auth system"
- Side Thread: "Why is this error happening?"

### 3) Career / Planning
- Main Thread: "Make a placement roadmap"
- Side Thread: "What if my CGPA is low?"

### 4) General users (daily tasks)
- Main Thread: "Plan my trip"
- Side Thread: "Is this hotel safe / what about budgeting?"

---

## Benefits
- Cleaner and more organized conversations
- Better revisiting / revision of key content
- Reduced clutter while still supporting exploration
- Useful for students, developers, and normal everyday users

---

## Optional Enhancements (Future Ideas)
- Convert Side Thread message into Main Thread content
- Tag side-thread questions (Important / Later / Quick)
- Search or filter within side-thread questions
- Export: Main Thread + Side Thread separately

---

## Request
I believe this feature would significantly improve ChatGPT’s user experience for both learning and regular daily usage.

If OpenAI implements this feature (or something very similar), attribution/credit would be appreciated if possible.
